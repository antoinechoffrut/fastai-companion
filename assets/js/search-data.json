            "content": "The Zen of Python and import * invocations . The fastai library is designed to safely invoke import * to import everything from a module. While this is often considered to go against Python&#39;s &quot;Explicit is better than implicit&quot;, this deliberate choice is explained in the fastai documentation. . It remains an instructive exercise to uncover which module contains a specific definition. Also, for debugging purposes, it may be useful at times to load only what is needed, to narrow down the range of possible sources of errors. . Monkey patching . In another notebook, we have seen that the fastai library adds convenience methods to classes from third party libraries. The use case was the method ls added to the pathlib class Path. This was done automatically via an import * invocation, which loads everything in the namespace in the specified libraries. . This notebook shows how to load the class Path and its added methods only. . . tags: programming exploration debugging python fastai . What is Path? . An expedient way to find out everything we need to know about Path is given from IPython&#39;s ? command: . from fastai2.vision.all import * Path? . The command above displays its output in a separate banner at the bottom of the page of the web browser. To access the same information directly: . from fastai2.vision.all import * import inspect print(&quot;Description for Path:&quot;) print(Path.__doc__) print(f&quot;Name of module defining Path: {inspect.getmodule(Path).__name__}&quot;) # or directly: Path.__module__ print(f&quot;Path to file with module source code: {inspect.getmodule(Path).__file__}&quot;) . Description for Path: PurePath subclass that can make system calls. Path represents a filesystem path but unlike PurePath, also offers methods to do system calls on path objects. Depending on your system, instantiating a Path will return either a PosixPath or a WindowsPath object. You can also instantiate a PosixPath or WindowsPath directly, but cannot instantiate a WindowsPath on a POSIX system or vice versa. Name of module defining Path: pathlib Path to file with module source code: /Users/antoine/.pyenv/versions/3.8.1/lib/python3.8/pathlib.py . Conclusion: Path is a class from the pathlib library, which is part of the Python install. . What is Path.ls? . The relevant information is displayed in a separate banner with: . from fastai2.vision.all import * Path.ls? . Direct access: . from fastai2.vision.all import * import inspect print(&quot;Description for Path.ls:&quot;) print((Path.ls).__doc__) print(f&quot;Name of module defining Path.ls: {inspect.getmodule(Path.ls).__name__}&quot;) # or directly: (Path.ls).__module__ print(f&quot;Path to file with module source code: {inspect.getmodule(Path.ls).__file__}&quot;) . Description for Path.ls: Contents of path as a list Name of module defining Path.ls: fastcore.utils Path to file with module source code: /Users/antoine/fastai/fastcore/fastcore/utils.py . Conclusion: the function ls has been added as a method to the class Path. It is defined in the fastcore library, which collects functionalities not depending on PyTorch, unlike fastai. . Minimal imports . If one wishes only to import Path and the attributes added by fastai, run . %xdel Path from pathlib import Path from fastcore.utils import ls print(f&quot;Name of module defining Path: {inspect.getmodule(Path).__name__}&quot;) # or directly: Path.__module__ print(f&quot;Path to file with module source code: {inspect.getmodule(Path).__file__}&quot;) print(f&quot;Name of module defining Path.ls: {inspect.getmodule(Path.ls).__name__}&quot;) # or directly: (Path.ls).__module__ print(f&quot;Path to file with module source code: {inspect.getmodule(Path.ls).__file__}&quot;) .

            "content": "Monkey patching . &quot;We do it in fastai all the time.&quot; Jeremy Howard . (from Swift For TensorFlow AND FastAI:Part 2, featuring Chris Lattner) Monkey patching refers to the practise of dynamically modifying classes and modules. This is done quite frequently in the fastai library. . This notebook dissects one common example, namely the ls() method added to the Path class from the pathlib Python library, which functionalities reminiscent of the ls command in bash. From the fastcore documentation: . We add an ls() method to pathlib.Path which is simply defined as list(Path.iterdir()), mainly for convenience in REPL environments such as notebooks. . . tags:programming python fastai exploration . The pathlib module . The pathlib module provides functionalities to handle filesystem paths. . from pathlib import Path path = Path().home() dir_native = dir(path) print(f&quot;Path to home directory: {str(path)}&quot;) print(f&#39;Object path has attribute ls: {&quot;ls&quot; in dir_native}&#39;) . Path to home directory: /Users/antoine Object path has attribute ls: False . Supercharging Path objects with fastai . We first remove the Path class from our scope so that we can load it again via fastai (read on): . %xdel Path try: Path print(&quot;This will fail so this won&#39;t print&quot;) except NameError: print(&quot;Class `Path` has been removed.&quot;) . NameError: name &#39;Path&#39; is not defined Class `Path` has been removed. . The following will automatically load Path (among many other things): . from fastai2.vision.all import * path = Path().home() dir_fastai = dir(path) print(f&quot;Path to home directory: {str(path)}&quot;) print(f&#39;Object path has attribute ls: {&quot;ls&quot; in dir_fastai}&#39;) . Path to home directory: /Users/antoine Object path has attribute ls: True . The ls method is one of several attributes that fastai (in fact, fastcore, read on) adds to the Path class. The list of added attributes is: . set(dir_fastai) - set(dir_native) . {&#39;load&#39;, &#39;load_array&#39;, &#39;ls&#39;, &#39;read&#39;, &#39;readlines&#39;, &#39;save&#39;, &#39;save_array&#39;, &#39;write&#39;} . Loading Path and Path.ls only? . It is an instructive exercise to find out how to load Path and its attributes added in the fastai library only. This is done in another notebook. .",
